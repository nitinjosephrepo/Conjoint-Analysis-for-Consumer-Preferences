## What is Cojoint Analysis?
Conjoint analysis is a form of statistical analysis that firms use in market research to understand how customers value different components or features of their products or services. 

In other words it's a research technique to measure what consumers value most about your products and services. For example, a TV manufacturer would want to know if customers value picture or sound quality more, or if they value low price more than picture quality. Conjoint analysis helps put a value on each feature, allowing you to tailor your products and services to what most consumers are seeking.
